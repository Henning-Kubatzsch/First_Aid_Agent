**Question:**

* How do I recognize a cardiac arrest?
* What’s the difference between normal and abnormal breathing?
* What should I do if someone suddenly collapses?

**Recognising Cardiac Arrest:**

* Cardiac arrest is likely if a person is **unresponsive** and shows **no normal breathing**.
* Watch for **agonal respiration** (slow, gasping breaths) – treat this as abnormal.
* Brief **seizure-like movements** may occur at onset. If breathing is absent → start CPR immediately.

**Question:**

* When should I call emergency services?
* Should I call first or start compressions first?
* How do I get help if I’m alone?

**Calling Emergency Services:**

* Dial **112 (or your local emergency number)** right away if the person is unresponsive and not breathing.
* If alone, use **speakerphone** so you can start CPR while following dispatcher instructions.
* If you must leave to make the call, always **activate EMS first, then return for CPR**.

**Question:**

* How do I perform chest compressions correctly?
* Where should I place my hands on the chest?
* How fast and how deep should I press?

**High-Quality Chest Compressions:**

* Start compressions quickly on the **lower half of the breastbone**.
* Push **5–6 cm deep** at a rate of **100–120 per minute**.
* Allow full chest recoil and avoid long pauses.
* Use a firm surface if available.

**Question:**

* Do I always need to give rescue breaths?
* What if I don’t want to do mouth-to-mouth?
* What is the correct compression-to-breath ratio?

**Rescue Breaths:**

* Standard cycle: **30 compressions + 2 breaths**.
* If trained and able: give breaths with visible chest rise.
* If unwilling or unable: continue **hands-only CPR**.

---

**Question:**

* Where can I find an AED?
* How do I recognize an AED device?
* Should I send someone else to look for it while I do CPR?

**Finding an AED:**

* AEDs are often placed in **public areas** such as stations, airports, and malls.
* Look for the **green AED sign** or ask bystanders to locate one.
* Send the nearest available person while compressions continue.

---

**Question:**

* How do I use an AED?
* Should I pause CPR to set it up?
* What do I do when the device starts talking?

**Using an AED:**

* Switch the AED on immediately and **attach pads** to the bare chest.
* Continue CPR while pads are applied, if multiple rescuers are present.
* Follow **audio and visual prompts** carefully.
* Ensure no one touches the patient during analysis or shock delivery.

---

**Question:**

* Should I keep compressing until the AED is ready?
* Do I delay defibrillation if I continue CPR?
* What happens between shocks?

**Compressions Before Defibrillation:**

* Perform CPR until the AED or defibrillator is ready.
* As soon as it signals to deliver a shock → **do not delay**.
* Resume compressions immediately after shock or “no shock” advice.

---

**Question:**

* What is a fully automatic AED?
* Do I still need to press a button?
* Are automatic devices safe to use?

**Fully Automatic AEDs:**

* Some devices deliver shocks **without pressing a button**.
* They are considered safe and reduce hesitation, though large-scale safety data is limited.
* Always follow prompts until EMS arrives.

---

**Question:**

* Is using an AED dangerous for bystanders?
* Can I accidentally shock myself or someone else?
* What if I misuse the device?

**AED Safety:**

* AEDs are designed for safe use by lay rescuers.
* Risk of shock to bystanders is **extremely low** if no contact during discharge.
* Compressions must stop during shock but resume right after.

---

**Question:**

* Is it safe for me to perform CPR?
* Can I injure someone if they are not actually in cardiac arrest?
* What are the risks of infection or accidental shock?

**General Safety:**

* Secure the environment before approaching the patient.
* CPR on someone not in cardiac arrest rarely causes harm.
* Risks of infection or accidental shock are minimal compared to the potential benefit.

---

**Question:**

* Can technology help me during an emergency?
* Are there apps or systems that alert rescuers?
* Do drones really deliver AEDs?

**Technology Support:**

* Emergency systems may use **apps, AI, drones, or video calls**.
* These tools help detect cardiac arrest, guide CPR, and deliver AEDs faster.
* Always prioritise manual action first – technology is supportive, not a replacement.

**Question:**

* How do I recognize choking?
* What should I do if coughing doesn’t work?
* How do I perform the Heimlich manoeuvre?

**Airway Obstruction (Choking):**

* Choking often occurs suddenly while eating or drinking.
* Encourage strong **coughing** if effective.
* If not: give up to **5 back blows**, then up to **5 abdominal thrusts**.
* Alternate back blows and thrusts until airway clears or the person collapses → then start CPR.

**Question:**

* How do I check if someone is unconscious?
* What’s the best way to assess responsiveness?
* How do I know if a person is just asleep or in danger?

**Checking Responsiveness:**

* Approach the person safely and speak loudly: “Are you okay?”
* Gently shake their shoulders if there is no response.
* If they do not move, speak, or open their eyes → treat as unconscious.

---

**Question:**

* How do I keep an unconscious person safe if they are breathing?
* When should I place someone in the recovery position?
* What’s the correct way to position the body?

**Recovery Position:**

* If the person is breathing but unresponsive, place them in the **recovery position**.
* Roll them onto their side, tilt the head back slightly, and keep the airway open.
* Bend the top leg for stability and ensure the mouth is angled downward to prevent aspiration.

---

**Question:**

* How do I check if someone is breathing normally?
* Should I check for a pulse as well?
* What’s the fastest way to decide if CPR is needed?

**Checking Breathing:**

* Look for **chest movement**, listen for breathing sounds, and feel for air on your cheek.
* Take no more than **10 seconds** to decide.
* If breathing is absent or abnormal (agonal), start CPR immediately.

---

**Question:**

* How do I protect the airway of an unconscious person?
* What should I do if their tongue blocks breathing?
* How can I make sure the airway stays open?

**Airway Management:**

* Use the **head tilt–chin lift** method: tilt the head back, lift the chin upward.
* This moves the tongue away from the airway.
* If spinal injury is suspected, use a **jaw thrust** without tilting the head.

---

**Question:**

* Should I remove objects from the mouth?
* What do I do if the person vomits while unconscious?
* How do I keep the airway clear?

**Clearing the Airway:**

* Check the mouth for vomit, food, or loose objects.
* Remove visible obstructions with a finger sweep only if safe.
* If vomiting occurs, place the person in the recovery position to prevent aspiration.

---

**Question:**

* What if the unconscious person has diabetes, epilepsy, or another condition?
* Should I give food, sugar, or medicine?
* Do I wait for EMS or intervene directly?

**Considering Medical History:**

* Ask bystanders or look for medical bracelets/ID cards.
* Do **not** give food, drink, or medication to an unconscious person.
* Pass all information about known conditions or medications to EMS.

---

**Question:**

* How long should I continue CPR?
* When is it safe to stop resuscitation?
* Do I stop if I feel tired?

**When to Stop CPR:**

* Continue compressions until **EMS arrives**, an AED instructs otherwise, or another trained rescuer takes over.
* Stop only if the person shows clear signs of life (normal breathing, movement).
* If exhaustion prevents continuation, seek immediate replacement.
