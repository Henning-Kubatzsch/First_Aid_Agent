# First Aid & Resuscitation – Simplified Training Guidelines


## Recognising Cardiac Arrest
* If a person is **unresponsive** and has **no normal breathing**, start CPR immediately.
* **Abnormal breathing** (e.g., slow, gasping breaths / agonal respiration) is a strong indicator of cardiac arrest.
* At the onset, brief **seizure-like movements** may occur. After they stop: if the person is still unresponsive and not breathing normally → begin CPR.


## Calling Emergency Services
* If someone is unresponsive and not breathing normally → **call emergency services right away**.
* A lone rescuer with a mobile phone should dial the emergency number, activate speaker mode, and start CPR while following dispatcher guidance.
* If you must leave to make the call, **activate EMS first, then begin CPR**.


## High-Quality Chest Compressions
* **Start compressions as soon as possible**.
* Place hands on the lower half of the breastbone (middle of the chest).
* Push down **5–6 cm deep** at a rate of **100–120 per minute**, minimizing interruptions.
* Allow the chest to fully recoil after each compression.
* Perform compressions on a firm surface if available.


## Rescue Breaths
* Standard cycle: **30 compressions, then 2 breaths**.
* If unable or unwilling to give breaths → continue with **compressions only**.


## Finding an AED
* AED locations should be **clearly marked with signs**.


## Using an AED
* As soon as an AED is available → **switch it on**.
* Attach electrode pads to the bare chest as shown on the device.
* If more than one rescuer is present, CPR should continue while pads are applied.
* Follow the device’s **audio and visual prompts**.
* Ensure **no one touches the patient** during rhythm analysis or shock delivery.
* If a shock is advised → press the shock button (or allow the device to deliver automatically). Immediately restart CPR with 30 compressions.
* If no shock is advised → immediately restart CPR.
* Continue CPR until the AED instructs another rhythm check (usually every 2 minutes).


## Compressions Before Defibrillation
* Continue CPR until the AED/defibrillator is connected and ready.
* Once the defibrillator is prepared, **do not delay the shock**.


## Fully Automatic AEDs
* Some AEDs deliver shocks without rescuer input.
* These devices are considered safe, though large-scale safety data is limited.


## AED Safety
* Studies show AEDs are safe for bystander use.
* The risk of shock to a rescuer is extremely low, but **compressions must stop during shock delivery**.


## General Safety
* Always ensure the environment is safe for you, the patient, and others.
* Lay rescuers should not hesitate: performing CPR on someone **not in arrest rarely causes harm**.
* Risks of infection or accidental shock are very low.


## Technology Support
* Emergency systems may use **smartphones, video calls, AI, or drones** to help identify cardiac arrest, provide dispatcher-guided CPR, alert nearby responders, or deliver AEDs to the scene.


## Airway Obstruction (Choking)
* Suspect choking if someone suddenly cannot talk or breathe, often while eating.
* Encourage them to **cough forcefully**.
* If ineffective: deliver up to **5 back blows** between the shoulder blades.
* If still obstructed: give up to **5 abdominal thrusts (Heimlich manoeuvre)**:

  * Stand behind the person, wrap arms around the upper abdomen.
  * Place a fist between the navel and ribs, grasp it with the other hand.
  * Pull sharply inward and upward.
* Alternate between 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts until the blockage clears or the person becomes unconscious.
* If they collapse → **start CPR immediately**.
