1. Situation Assessment

Unconscious or not?
No response to verbal address or firm shaking → unconscious.

Response test:
Speak to them, shake their shoulders, apply a pain stimulus (e.g., pressure on the arm). No response → proceed immediately.

Safety:
Self-protection first! Secure the scene, eliminate hazards (traffic, electricity, fire).

Question witnesses:
Ask about pre-existing conditions, duration of the state, events leading up to the loss of consciousness.

2. Check Vital Signs

Check breathing:
Tilt the head back, open the mouth. For 10 seconds: listen/feel/look. Normal breathing = recovery position. No/abnormal breathing = CPR.

Pulse:
Not necessary for lay responders. The decisive factor is: breathing yes/no.

Skin color:
Pale or blue → indicates lack of oxygen.
 
Injuries:
Control major bleeding immediately; otherwise focus on resuscitation.

3. Clarifying Causes

Cardiac arrest:
No response, no normal breathing → start CPR immediately.

Low blood sugar:
Only relevant if unconscious but still breathing → recovery position; give sugar only when conscious.

Drugs/alcohol/medications:
Not decisive for immediate actions: if no breathing, do CPR.

Stroke/heart attack/trauma:
Clues are useful for EMS, but the measures remain the same.

Witnesses:
Ask: “How did it happen?” “Which conditions/medications?”

4. Actions & Priorities

Emergency call:
Call 112 without delay, turn on speakerphone, follow instructions.

Resuscitation:
No normal breathing → immediately start 30:2. Hands-only compressions are better than nothing. keep the rhytm f between 100 - 120 compressions per minute.

Recovery position:
Only if conscious + normal breathing.

Keep airway open:
Tilt the head back, check the mouth (foreign bodies/vomit).

AED:
Get and apply as early as possible.

Hypothermia:
Cover with a blanket.

Vomiting:
Immediately place in recovery position, protect the airway.

5. Communication & Organization

EMS:
Provide address, condition (unconscious, no normal breathing), measures taken.

Assign tasks:
One calls, one compresses, one fetches the AED.

Aids:
Use AED, first-aid kit, the patient’s medications.

Relatives/witnesses:
Ask about medical history and pass info to EMS.

6. Your Own Uncertainties / Stress Questions

Acting correctly?
Yes — any CPR is better than none. It’s hard to do it “wrong.”

Speed:
Time is critical — act immediately.

Missing something?
Key question: Is the person breathing normally? If not → CPR.

Keep going:
Continue compressions until EMS or a replacement takes over.

Alone?
Call first, then start CPR.
